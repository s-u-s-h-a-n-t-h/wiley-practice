Employee

-> No multivalued attributes.
-> Primary Key (Id) exists.
-> All records are uniquely identified

-->Its in 1NF

PK
Id   name   project        company     cost_incurred_in_project

1    Emp1   1st project     MNC1            1000

2    Emp2   1st project     MNC1            1000

3    Emp3   2nd project     MNC2             800

4    Emp4   1st project     MNC1            1000

5    Emp5   2nd project     MNC2             800

6    Emp6   3rd project     MNC3            2000

-> Here employee Id is primary key and no other candidate keys can be found.
-> So no "partial dependencies" are observed.
--> Its in 2NF


-> Here a project is taken up by only one company and cost is also dependent on project.
-> We can clearly see the "transitive dependency", project -> company, cost.

breaking it down to 2 tables, 1. Employee, 2. Project table.

Project Table:

PK
Id    name    		  company     cost

P1    1st Project      MNC1       1000

P2    2nd Project      MNC2        800

P3    3rd Project      MNC3       2000


Employee Table:

PK
Id    name     projectId

1     Emp1      P1

2     Emp2      P1

3     Emp3      P2
        .
        .
        .
        .
        .
        .
6     Emp6      P3

--> Now its in 3NF.
